A simple site which contains a code project with a documentation in form of github pages

## To DO
1. Update License with correct owner
1. Update Gitignore with all files that should not be uploaded
1. Update the _config.yml with the correct page meta data
1. Update this ReadMe with an appropriate description of the project

## Dokumentation
The documentation is created in form of GitHub pages following the official documentation:  
[installation guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

To run the documentation locally Jekyll is required. Follow the official installation [guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll for the appropriate OS. It is important to install the correct version to prevent potential problems with Github Pages. The officially supported version is listed [here](https://pages.github.com/versions/).  
The following command starts a local server, if Jekyll is installed with bundler:
```bash 
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
