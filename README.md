# Heimdall Voice-Assistant

Heimdall is part of the [INTIA](https://dites.web.th-koeln.de/forschung/projekte/intia/) project.

During this project we try to develop a private and local Voice-Assistant, based on open-source technologies. The Assistant
is supposed to be used in education and diaconal institutions, like orphanages or homes for elderly or disabled people.

While providing a save and fun way to get accustomed to future technologies, we don't want any personal data stored on 
external or even foreign servers, since heimdalls users might be vulnerable and or exploitable.

Our part in this project was to evaluate different technologies by first installing them on a raspberry pi (an affordable 
mini computer) and afterwards implementing different skills, like telling [current time](./docs/pages/features/not-required/current-time.md),
setting [alarms](./docs/pages/features/alarms.md), or getting a [weather forecast](./docs/pages/features/weather.md).
We try to answer the following questions:

- How easy are these technologies to implement and use?
- How well are the technologies working together? 
- How good and reliable are the results of our skills? 
- Does it run private and local? Or do we need to compromise to achive certain goals?

You can read more about the process and the results of our research on our documentation website [ip-team2.intia.de](https://ip-team2.intia.de/).
