During the presentation we talked about a German startup with similar goals regarding the development of a privat Voice-
Assistant. This startup is [A\\WARE](https://a-ware.io) with their assistant [AVA](https://ava.a-ware.io/de/). The AVA-app seems to 
be removed from the Google Play store. According to their website there code is open source and you can find their
[github repository here](https://github.com/aware-ai/AVA). It got only three commits from August 2020.
