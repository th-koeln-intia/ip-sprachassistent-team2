# Troubleshooting Hermes

We are unable to use Hermes-Mqtt as Dialogue-Management in Rhasspy v2.5.5.  
When Precise detects our wake-word, Hermes does not activate Kaldi to recognise our voice commands.  
It simply stops the session.  
We switched to Rhasspy's own Dialogue-Management-System, just called "Rhasspy".
