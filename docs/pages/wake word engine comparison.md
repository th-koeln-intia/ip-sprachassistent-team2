# Wake Word Engine

For our project we need a Wake-Word or Hot Word Engine, which is local and always listens 
to for the user to start all the other processes.

## Criteria

Since the finished product is supposed to be used by probably vulnerable individuals in charity organisations, we need 
to consider following criteria:
-	Local and private
-	Open source and free to use
-	Supported by a bigger community or company

Furthermore, it would be nice if its easy to use and we could monetize the product, because we can not limit the use to 
charity.


## Options

There are several possible engines which are the following:
- [precise by mycroft](#precise-by-mycroft)
- [pocketsphinx](###pocketsphinx)
- [porcuppine](###porcuppine)
- [raven](### raven)
- [Snips](### Snips)
- [Snowboy](### Snowboy)

### precise by mycroft (#precise-by-mycroft)

Available on Github under the Apache 2.0 license. It is maintained by Mycroft AI Inc Kansas City, who sell AI assistant
 hardware with their software and merchandise to support them selfâ€™s. It is possible to train custom wake words as 
 documented [here]( https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise/wiki/Training-your-own-wake-word#how-to-train-your-own-wake-word).
