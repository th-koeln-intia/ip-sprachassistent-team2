## Introduction

This project is part of [INTIA](https://dites.web.th-koeln.de/forschung/projekte/research-projects-intia/).

The aim of project is to improve possibilities of digital participation for clients of social work organisations and other
institutions.   

To achieve this goal we want to develop a private and local voice assistant. The user should be able to control lights and 
other Internet of Things (IoT) devices locally without internet access, as well as search for information on wikipedia.
On top of this the user should be able to ask for the time, set alarms and timers. If there are use cases which require 
internet access e.g. playing music or getting a weather report, we want no personal information to be send to external 
servers. Here you can read more about the [features](pages/features/index.md).

For our voice assistant we want to use [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on a Raspberry Pi 
and multiple open source software packages, which you can find in the our [tech-stack](pages/tech-stack/index.md) section.
